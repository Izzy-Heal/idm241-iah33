    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>My passion for art and music is what really inspired this project. I was able to combine my artistic vision with the music that often inspires it.</p>
    
    <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
    <p>The assignmet was to create a microinteraction in three phases, the Alpha, Beta and Final. The Alpha had to be based on a website that already exists, but the Beta and Final could come from my own ideas. At each stage of the process they leveled up in complexity. </p>

    <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
    <p>For my Alpha I created something that had very little reation to what my Final project ended up being.
        I decided to design an interaction that would occur when you retweet soething on Twitter.
        this can be seen <a href="../alpha/build/index.html">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>My Beta project was when I started with the idea of hovering over an image of my art and it fading from black and white 
        to color. This idea ended up being a component of my final project. View the Beta <a href="../beta/build/index.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>My passion for art and music is what really inspired this project.</p>

    <h2>The Results</h2>
