    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>My passion for art and music is what really inspired this project. I was able to combine my artistic vision with the music that often inspires it.</p>
    
    <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
    <p>The assignmet was to create a microinteraction in three phases, the Alpha, Beta and Final. 
        The Alpha had to be based on a website that already exists, but the Beta and Final could come from my own ideas. At each stage of the process they leveled up in complexity. 
    I wanted to creat e microinteraction that Icoul use when I redesign my portfolio website to add interest and excitement to displying my art. 
    </p>

    <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
    <p>For my Alpha I created something that had very little reation to what my Final project ended up being.
        I decided to design an interaction that would occur when you retweet soething on Twitter.
        this can be seen <a href="../alpha/build/index.html">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>My Beta project was when I started with the idea of hovering over an image of my art and it fading from black and white 
        to color. This idea ended up being a component of my final project. View the Beta <a href="../beta/build/index.html">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Coming up with this Beta concept was great because I knew I did not want to continue to work with Twitter as the basis for my interaction.
        Iwas pretty stuck with what to do for my project. As i was pondering what to do I started working on some art and realized my interaction could involve my art.
        I looked through my portfolio of pieces and thought about how much color there is in my art and how it might look cool to have pieces fade from black and white into color.
        I think my Beta turned out really well, but then I had to decide what to do for my Final. Iknew Iwanted to stick with the same concept so I had to find something to add,
        and I settled on music. Every time I draw I am listening to music, so I wanted to bring that idea into the displaying of my work as well.
