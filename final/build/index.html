                    <p>This piece is titled Teeth. I love using a monochromatic red color scheme when drawing, and the idea of making this personâ€™s hair into devil spikes was very fun. I also tried to add a lot of texture to the piece even though it is a digital art piece.  The piece was featured in the online art magazine Grain of Salt Magazine</p>
                    <p>I used myself as a reference for this piece and it symbolizes my personal journey with genderand nonconfomity. I put the most attention into the eyes, giving the subject deep bags under their eyes. </p>
